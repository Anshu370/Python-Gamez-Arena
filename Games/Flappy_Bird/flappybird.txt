# Flappy Bird Game Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation provides information on how to play the Flappy Bird game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the Pygame library using pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game**
   - Run the Python script containing the Flappy Bird game code.
   - The game window will appear, titled "Flappy Bird".

2. **Controls**
   - Press the space bar to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
   - Release the space bar to allow the bird to descend due to gravity.

3. **Objective**
   - Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes without colliding with them.
   - Each successful passage through the gap earns one point.

4. **Game Over**
   - The game ends if the bird collides with the top or bottom of the game window.
   - The game also ends if the bird collides with any of the pipes.

5. **Scoring**
   - The score is displayed at the center of the game window.
   - Each time the bird successfully passes through a gap between pipes, the score increases by one.

6. **Restarting the Game**
   - After the game ends, you can restart it by closing the game window and running the Python script again.

## Code Overview
- The game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library for graphics and input handling.
- The bird is controlled by changing its vertical position based on user input (space bar) and gravity.
- Pipes are randomly generated and move from right to left across the screen.
- Collision detection is used to determine if the bird collides with the pipes or the boundaries of the game window.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
